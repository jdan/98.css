98.css is a CSS file that takes semantic HTML and makes it look pretty. It does not ship with any JavaScript, so it is compatible with your frontend framework of choice.

### Installation / Usage

The easiest way to use 98.css is to import it from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>98.css example</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/98.css" />
</head>

<body>
  <div class="window" style="margin: 32px; width: 250px">
    <div class="title-bar">
      <div class="title-bar-text">
        My First VB4 Program
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="window-body">
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

You can use `npm start` to start a development environment that will watch for file changes and rebuild 98.css, reloading your browser in the process.

You can run a build manually with `npm run build`. This will write to the `dist/` directory.
